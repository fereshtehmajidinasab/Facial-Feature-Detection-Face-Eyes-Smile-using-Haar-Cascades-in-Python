# Facial Feature Detection (Face, Eyes & Smile) 

Hi there!  

This project is a simple example of facial feature detection using **Python** and **OpenCV**. It detects **faces, eyes, and smiles** in real-time using Haar Cascade classifiers.

It’s a great beginner-friendly computer vision project if you want to understand how object detection works with a webcam.

When you run the program:

- It opens your webcam.
